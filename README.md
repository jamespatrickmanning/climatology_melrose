climatology of the NE contental shelf based on Chris Melrose processing of CTD data

getclim_def.py is an example function used to get climatology

Important note:  In order for this to work, you will need to have the data files which do not fit on Github but are shared in a google folder (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CBnkL1K1kR1zADD_uSYN6_K0Rop9Nndx) for downloading.  If you are going to use just the Bottom_Temperatures, for example, you only need that folder along with the LatGrid.csv and LonGrid.csv files.
